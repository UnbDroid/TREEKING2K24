CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/caldo/Projetos/TREKKING-2024-2025/build/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/caldo/project-name/build where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/home/caldo/Projetos/TREKKING-2024-2025/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/home/caldo/project-name/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
